                    <h3> Understanding Air Quality Index (AQI) </h3>
                    <p> The AQI is a standardized indicator used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it 
                        is forecast to become. Here's a quick overview: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class = "aqi-legend good"></span> <strong> Good (0-50): </strong> Air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution 
                            poses little or no risk.</li>
                        <li><span class = "aqi-legend moderate"></span> <strong> Moderate (51-100): </strong> Air quality is acceptable; however, 
                            there may be a risk for some people, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.</li>
                        <li><span class = "aqi-legend unhealthy-sensitive"></span> <strong> Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150):</strong> Members 
                            of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is less likely to be affected.</li>
                        <li><span class = "aqi-legend unhealthy"></span> <strong> Unhealthy (151-200): </strong> Everyone may begin to experience 
                            health effects; members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.</li>
                        <li><span class = "aqi-legend very-unhealthy"></span> <strong> Very Unhealthy (201-300):</strong> Health warnings of 
                            emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely to be affected.</li>
                        <li><span class = "aqi-legend hazardous"></span> <strong> Hazardous (301-500): </strong> Health alert: everyone may experience
