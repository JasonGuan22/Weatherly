                <h3> The Information Problem We Address </h3>
                <p> Weatherly was created to tackle the challenge of making weather and air quality data more accessible and actionable. Many individuals struggle to find 
                    reliable, real-time environmental information in a format that is easy to understand. This lack of accessible data can lead to missed opportunities for 
                    preparation, especially in the face of severe weather or poor air quality conditions. </p>

                <p> By providing a centralized platform that integrates weather and pollution data, we aim to close this gap, helping people make informed choices about their 
                    daily activities and long-term planning. </p>
